# Scene Generation Unity - PC/VR application showcasing 3D and 2D generation for scene creation
 
## 📖 Project Overview

Scene Generation is an experimental application that explores the integration of 2D and 3D generative AI models to assist in the rapid creation of virtual scenes. Designed for both PC and VR environments, the application allows seamless switching between modes at any time during the creative process.

The core concept revolves around a generative workflow that goes from text prompt → 2D image → 3D model. Text prompts are used to generate either repeatable textures or 360° skyboxes through a 2D generative model. These 2D outputs can then serve as conditioning inputs for 3D model generation tools, enabling users to progressively construct their scene with minimal manual modeling.

In addition, early integration tests were performed with a Large Language Model (LLM) to help users ideate and suggest potentially useful scene objects, streamlining the design process even further.

This project was conducted over a five-month research internship in Japan, as part of a scientific collaboration. It was developed by two Master’s students as their final graduation project—which they successfully completed.
